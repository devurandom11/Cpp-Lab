# Car Class

Given main(), complete the Car class (in files Car.h and Car.cpp) with member functions to set and get the purchase price of a car (SetPurchasePrice(), GetPurchasePrice()), and to output the car's information (PrintInfo()).

Ex: If the input is:

~~~ cpp
2011
18000
2018
~~~

where 2011 is the car's model year, 18000 is the purchase price, and 2018 is the current year, the output is:

~~~ cpp
Car's information:
  Model year: 2011
  Purchase price: $18000
  Current value: $5770
~~~

Note: PrintInfo() should use two spaces for indentation.
