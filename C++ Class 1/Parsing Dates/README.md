# Parsing Dates

Complete `main()` to read dates from input, one date per line. Each date's format must be as follows: March 1, 1990. Any date not following that format is incorrect and should be ignored. Use the `substr()` function to parse the string and extract the date. The input ends with -1 on a line alone. Output each correct date as: 3/1/1990.

Ex: If the input is:

~~~cpp
March 1, 1990
April 2 1995
7/15/20
December 13, 2003
-1
~~~

then the output is:

~~~cpp
3/1/1990
12/13/2003
~~~
