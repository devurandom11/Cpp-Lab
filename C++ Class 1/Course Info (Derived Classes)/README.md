# Course Info (Derived Classes)

Given `main()`, define a Course base class with functions to set and get the `courseNumber` and `courseTitle`. Also define a derived class `OfferedCourse` with functions to set and get `instructorName`, `term`, and `classTime`.

Ex. If the input is:

```cpp
ECE287
Digital Systems Design
ECE387
Embedded Systems Design
Mark Patterson
Fall 2018
WF: 2-3:30 pm
```

the output is:

```cpp
Course Information:
Course Number: ECE287
Course Title: Digital Systems Design
Course Information:
Course Number: ECE387
Course Title: Embedded Systems Design
Instructor Name: Mark Patterson
Term: Fall 2018
Class Time: WF: 2-3:30 pm
```
