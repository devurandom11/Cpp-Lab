# 9.10 LAB: Inventory (linked lists: insert at the front of a list)

Given `main()`, define an `InsertAtFront()` member function in the InventoryNode class that inserts items at the front of a linked list (after the dummy head node).

Ex. If the input is:

```cpp
4
plates 100
spoons 200
cups 150
forks 200
```

the output is:

```cpp
200 forks
150 cups
200 spoons
100 plates
```
