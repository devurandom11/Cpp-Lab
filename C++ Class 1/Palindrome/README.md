# Palindrome

A palindrome is a string that reads the same backwards and forwards. Use a deque to implement a program that tests whether a line of text is a palindrome. The program reads a line, then outputs whether the input is a palindrome or not.

Ex: If the input is:

```cpp
senile felines!
```

the output is:

```cpp
Yes, "senile felines!" is a palindrome.
```

Ex: If the input is:

```cpp
rotostor
```

the output is:

```cpp
No, "rotostor" is not a palindrome.
```

Ignore punctuation and spacing. Assume all alphabetic characters will be lowercase.

Special case: A one-character string is a palindrome.
