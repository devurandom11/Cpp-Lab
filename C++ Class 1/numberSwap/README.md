# Swap Two Numbers

Complete the `Swap()` function in main.cpp to exchange the values of the num field of two Number objects, `num1` and `num2`. Since both `num1` and `num2` are changed inside `Swap()`, reference operators `(&)` are used to pass `num1` and `num2` by reference.

Hint: Refer to the given Number class to see the definitions of num field and other functions available.

Ex: If `num1` is 19 and `num2` is 178, calling `Swap(num1, num2)` will swap the values so that `num1` becomes 178 and `num2` becomes 19.
