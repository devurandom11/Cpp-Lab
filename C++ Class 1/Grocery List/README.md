# Grocery List

Given `main()`, define an `InsertAtEnd()` member function in the ItemNode class that adds an element to the end of a linked list. DO NOT print the dummy head node.

Ex. if the input is:

```cpp
4
Kale
Lettuce
Carrots
Peanuts
```

where 4 is the number of items to be inserted; Kale, Lettuce, Carrots, Peanuts are the names of the items to be added at the end of the list.

The output is:

```cpp
Kale
Lettuce
Carrots
Peanuts
```
